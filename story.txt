Once upon a time, three piggies went to market to pick up rice and beer.

Their names were Rihanna, MeganD, and Cardi.

The piggies went home and had a rice ball making party. They partied and danced around all night long. 

Until, Bill came to their door. Bill was banging at the door, yelling, "I WANT TO KNOW WHO BOUGHT ALL THE RICE AND BEER." 

The piggies went quiet. Then Cardi yelled out to Bill , "Come in and join us!"

The piggies and Bill, all lived happily ever after!
